## **INTRODUCTION.**

This web application has been developed in order to apply the topics covered within the recent Javascript essential course work as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer diploma. The website represents a simple Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game based on the idea presented in the popular TV series, 'The Big Bang Theory'. The game pits the user against the computer in a game of chance.

## **DESIGN GOALS.**

The brief was to create an interactive application that presents users with an enjoyable game of chance. The principle features included are a game that employs a pattern matching functionality with a limited number of tries before the game is completed. The score must be tracked and it must provide the facility to play against 'the computer'. In addition a competitive element has been added with colourful and entertaining visual and audio cues to engage the users interest.
