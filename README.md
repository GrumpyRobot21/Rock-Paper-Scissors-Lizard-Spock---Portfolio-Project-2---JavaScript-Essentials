## **INTRODUCTION.**

This web application has been developed in order to apply the topics covered within the recent Javascript essential course work as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer diploma. The website represents a Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game based on the premise presented in the popular TV series, 'The Big Bang Theory'. This game pits the user against the computer in a game of chance. To view the full website please use the clickable link via the heading at the top of this page or alternatively, click on the following link to access the site: [Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](https://grumpyrobot21.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock---Portfolio-Project-2---JavaScript-Essentials/)

<p align="right"><a href="#home">Top of page</a></p><p id="dg"></p>

## **DESIGN GOALS.**

The brief was to create an interactive application that presents users with an enjoyable game of chance. The principle features included are a game that employs a pattern matching functionality with a limited number of tries before the game is completed. The score must be tracked and it must provide the facility to play against 'the computer'. In addition a competitive element has been added with colourful and entertaining visual and audio cues to engage the users interest.

## **DESIGN FEATURES.**

- ### **Header Bar.**

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/headerbar.png"?raw=true alt=" picture of the navigation bar"></p>
This is a simple header displaying the title of the game. It is a clean and simlpe layout.

- ### **Footer.**

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/footer.png"?raw=true alt=" picture of the header bar"></p>
The footer has been designed to be informative and simple in it's presentation. It should not detract from the main page content yet provide relevant and helpful information for the user to engage with when required. The links to social media icons are clearly displayed. The icons are animated when the cursor is hovered above to clearly indicate which icon is being engaged by the user. Each link opens the relevant page in a separate tab. 

- ### **Page Design.**
  The single page design has been specifically created to portray a clean, fun and engaging experience for the user. The page content presented in a clear and accessible fashion for the user to understand.

1.  #### **Main Page.**

<p align="center">
 <img src="assets/images/screenshot.png"?raw=true alt="image of the home page"></p>
 <p align="center">

Below the navbar is the main game play area. This has the scoreboard clearly defined at the top of the page and the player feedback section immediately below. The game icons are laid out beneath that and they are aniimated to clearly show the user which one they are engaging with. The rules and how to play the game are in the box below giving the user clear instructions on how to play.

- ### **Colour Palette.**
  The colour palette is purposefully simple and clean. It consists almost entirely of the two following colours: #1e5c71 and White.
  <p align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/white.png"?raw=true alt=" sample of the blue shade used in the site design"></p>
   <p align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/designcolor.png"?raw=true alt=" sample of the blue shade used in the site design"></p>

These two colors provide a high level of contrast for users with impaired vison, as confirmed in the testing section below. They also add to the overall goal of creating a clear, professional and efficient design ethos. The colors were chosen in conjunction with the main logo to present a smooth, related connection across the application. This helps provide consistency to the overall aesthetic flow of the user experience.

- ### **Font.**
  The chosen font is a geometric sans serif typeface named Poppins. This is a modern and clean font that is easy and clear to interpret as well as adding to the modern design ethos of the site. This is the official font description courtesy of the google fonts page "Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the worldâ€™s stage. Poppins is one of the new comers to this long tradition. With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre."

## **USER STORY.**

For the purposes of this story, our 'First time' user will be called 'Bob'. Bob is a young professional who has a great number of online profiles and accounts across many platforms. Like most of Bob's generation, Bob does a lot of things online for recreational, personal and business purposes.

- Bob has looked up the site because he wants to learn more about the importance of managing his online digital legacy and he is aware that he has a growing portfolio of online data and assets to keep under control. He lands on the home page and is immediately struck by the hero banner quote. This piques his interest and he continues to read down the page where he learns a little about the company and what it does for potential clients. On reaching the bottom of the page Bob sees the prominent button to learn more. The social media icons are also clear and on display so Bob can easily subscribe to his preferred platforms and follow the WebLife media pages to be kept up to date on the latest news and developments. Bob clicks on the button to learn more. PAGE AIM: To capture the users interest while presenting the user with clear and concise navigation choices and clearly defined social media links.

- Bob is now on the ABOUT US page. This page elaborates on the initial information encountered previously. Here Bob is now more aware of the issues faced by modern internet users and how there is a need to be more in control of their online assets. Bob is now intrigued, curious and genuinely interested in a no strings attached free consultation with an expert. Bob clicks on the prominent action button at the foot of the page to move deeper into the application. PAGE AIM: To provide more detailed information and drive a users curiosity with the perception of an issue that needs to be dealt with. The ultimate goal is to drive traffic to the CONTACT US page and get the user to engage positively by submitting the completed form.

- Bob has now been taken to the CONTACT US submission form. He is unable to submit it until he has fully completed all of the fields. This is clearly indicated in a concise and helpful manner. Bob easily fills out the prerequisite information and submits the form. He is immediately informed that his message has been received and that an expert will be in touch within 24 hours. This pleases Bob and, as Bob is interested in keeping up with relevant news, he signs up to his preferred choice of social media accounts via the icons at the bottom of the page. PAGE AIM: To compel the user to complete the form and engage with the company directly. With the user filling in the form and submitting it the web application will have succeeded in it's primary purpose.

* ### **Returning Users.**
  This site in its current form is designed specifically to generate new customer leads and drive traffic to the contact page where they engage directly with the company. As a result it is not yet fully developed for returning users. This functionality will be addressed in the 'Future Aspirations' section below.

- ### **Chrome Dev Tools - Lighthouse - Testing**
  The Chrome dev tool - Lighthouse - Tests the overall performance, Accessibility, Web Development best practices and SEO. The following results were confirmed:

![WebLife](/assets/images/lighthouse-test-result.png)

- ### **Responsiveness Testing**

The following sites were used to test the web applications responsiveness: [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) and [Media Genesis Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/)

- The 'Am I responsive generator' result image has been used at the start of this readme file. Please see the image at the top for the results. This page focuses on the following image viewport sizes -
  Desktop
  1600x992px scaled down to scale(0.3181)
  Laptop
  1280x802px scaled down to scale(0.277)
  Tablet
  768x1024px scaled down to scale(0.219)
  Mobile
  320x480px scaled down to scale(0.219). The site results indicate good performance on all viewport sizes.

- The Media Genesis page gives the option to test the page on several different viewport screen sizes from Desktop 24 inch 1920 x 1200px resolution all the way down to the mobile viewport size of 320 x 480px. The site performed very well on all viewport size options.

- ### **Contrast/ Accessibility Testing**

The [Wave Accessibilty testing tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to check to test the page contrast and accessibilty of the application.

The colour contrast was AAA rated.

- ### **User Testing**

Friends and family were the resource used to extensively test the usability of the web application. All page links and button functionality were tested including ascertaining that all social media links opened in separate tabs and that all action buttons and nav links were correctly configured and redirected the user to the correct page, as indicated.

## **PREVIOUS ITERATIONS AND BUGS.**

The first iteration of this project was built without a proper uderstanding of the 'Mobile First' Developement concept. As a result it made it difficult to figure out the best approach to making the application responsive. Following engagement with Code Institute tutor support new concepts and ideas were discussed that helped resolve the decision to start again using some of the same design ideas but approaching the build from a new perspective. The end result was more responsive in its initial design from the ground up and as a result easier to complete than the first attempt.

- ### **Bugs**
  Apart from the usual spelling mistakes and formatting to tidy up, a number of bugs were identified during the testing phase and updated. These included but were not exclusively, having to add titles and aria labelling to the contact form to avoid the issue of not having specific labels **(The decision not to use labels in this instance was deliberate and in line with the specific design aspirations for the form layout.)**.

Updating the main images from .png files to .webp format in order to reduce loading times and caching issues.

Discovering redundant css styling while using the Chrome Developer tools but in the process understanding more about how these tools are extremely useful in the devlopment design and testing phase.

There will undoubtedly be other issues that I am currently unaware of and styling changes that I will make as I gain additional knowledge during the remaining course modules. It has been a very enjoyable albeit sometimes incredibly frustrating process but ultimately extremely rewarding and fun.

## **FUTURE ASPIRATIONS.**

These include an online portal or client area to allow clients the access for online management of portflios held with WebLife. This would include a secure passord or biometrically protected client area where various levels of service and functionality would be offered. This would further facilitate the 'returning user' element of the site. A futher refining of the design will be part of the ongoing application development in future.

Including the functionality for an emailed form submission clarification for users. The option for users to sign up for regular news and service updates.

Discovering what Bootstrap is has been enlightening as it would obviously make the whole process a little quicker and easier. However, having to complete all the code personally means that during this process I have gained experience of simply writing code and not relying on a Framework to do the heavy lifting, although I will be taking advantage of this where I can in future.
